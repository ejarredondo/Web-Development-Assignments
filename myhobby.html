		<dd>Even though I haven't had much free time recently because of classes, I love to sketch in my free time. One of my friends, who is in the art department, has helped me a lot with growing my style and assisted me with understanding concepts when sketching things. I mainly sketch people, as it's what I've always sketched. However, I do love to draw little sceneries here and there, even though they tend to look a bit messy.</dd>

		<dd>I did dance for many years when I was younger and even continued throughout high school with an extracurricular activity. With college, I haven't been able to maintain my skill as much, but I still enjoy freestyling, improving or making up choreographies in my head while I listen to music.</dd>

		<dd>Within the past year, I have been getting into more TV shows. I used to only watch movies as I found TV shows formatting to be weird, but I have grown to love it as it offers suspense that movies can't. Some of my favorite genres are crime, mystery, suspense, dystopian and science fiction. I tend to watch more British crime shows as I find the plots to be more interesting. A few of my favorites are Unforgotten, Tenison and The Tunnel.</dd>
